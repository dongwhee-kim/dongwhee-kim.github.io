Hello,
I am an incoming Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin (Advisor: [Prof. Poulami Das](https://www.poulamidas.com)). My research interests lie on improving the reliability of quantum computers and memory systems within computer architecture.

Prior to joining UT Austin, I worked as an HBM I/O Circuit Design Engineer at Samsung Electronics and obtained both my B.S. and M.S. degrees from Sungkyunkwan University in South Korea (Advisor: [Prof. Jungrae Kim](https://scalable-arch.github.io)).
